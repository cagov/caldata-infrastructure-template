  # Note: for SQLFluff we don't use the default pre-commit hook for a few reasons:
  #   1. dbt cloud looks for config in the dbt project directory, so we put it in
  #      transform/, however sqlfluff requires the templater config to be in the
  #      current working directory. So we have to cd to transform/ to properly set the
  #      templater config.
  #   2. Some machines (such as ODI Macs) seem to struggle with sqlfluff's
  #      multiprocessing implementation, so we force it to be single-process.
  #   3. The pre-commit managed python environment can be difficult to install,
  #      especially due to issues with pyarrow being brought in by Snowflake.
  #      This keep things more predictable by using the poetry.lock environment.
